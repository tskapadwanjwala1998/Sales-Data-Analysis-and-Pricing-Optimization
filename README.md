# Sales-Data-Analysis-and-Pricing-Optimization

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a sales dataset to gain insights for strategic decision making. It leverages machine learning techniques for unit price prediction, sales channel profitability analysis, and customer segmentation. 

## Data Description
The Kaggle dataset contains over 7,900 rows of regional US sales data across various channels with attributes like orders, products, dates, customers and costs. It is complete with no missing values. Link to the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/talhabu/us-regional-sales-data

## Methodology
The analysis involves data preprocessing like date standardization and numerical conversion. It then builds models for:

1. Unit price prediction using Random Forest Regressor  
2. Sales channel profitability analysis by calculating profit metrics
3. Customer segmentation using K-means clustering

## Results  
Key results include identifying the most profitable sales channel, defining customer pricing segments, and determining feature importance for price prediction. 
Accuracy of 80% was achieved for price prediction.

## Conclusion
Valuable insights into cost optimization, channel prioritization, and targeted marketing strategies were obtained. The clustering revealed diversity across customer groups.

## How to Run the Code
Install dependencies and run the Python(.ipynb) file in Jupyter notebook or Google Colab. Virtual environments are recommended for dependency management.

## Dependencies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn 

## Acknowledgements
